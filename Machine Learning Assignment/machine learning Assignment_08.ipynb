A few candidate feature subsets are generated since their number corresponds to the number of instances.\n",

    ">3. **`The width of the silhouette`**The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The value of the silhouette ranges between [1, -1], where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.\n",

    ">-False Positive Rate\n",
